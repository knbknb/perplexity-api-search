# Querying the Perplexity API

A spare-time project to explore the [Perplexity.ai API](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-online-llms).  This is a work in progress.  The goal is to make it easier to query the Perplexity.ai API, and to compare the results of different models.

##### In a Linux terminal, send your human-language query to Perplexity.ai's various LLM APIs  in a single loop.  

##### See Python Script [`explore_perplexity_api.py`](explore_perplexity_api.py) - rewrite of shell script . See [README-python.md](README-python.md) for more details.  - has fewer dependencies than the shell script (which was a first implementation).

##### See Shell Script [`explore_perplexity_api.sh`](explore_perplexity_api.sh) - first prototype . See [README-shell.md](README-shell.md) for more details.
