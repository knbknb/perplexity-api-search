However, jq is a powerful command-line JSON processor that allows you to filter, transform, and manipulate JSON data in various ways. It has built-in filters for extracting specific fields from objects, converting numbers to strings, and performing other standard tasks. Filters can be combined using pipes or by collecting their output into an array.\n\nWhile the specific idioms beginning with the @ symbol are not provided in the search results, you can explore the jq documentation, such as the jq manual or the jq cheat sheet, to learn more about the available filters and their usage. Additionally, you can test expressions using the jq play site or the jq command-line tool.\n"
