It is located in the country's central valley and is the center of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 7 million, representing 40% of Chile's total population. Santiago was founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia and has served as the capital city of Chile since colonial times. The city is known for its 19th-century neoclassical architecture, winding side-streets, and several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, which is lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park.\n"
