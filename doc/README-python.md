# Querying the Perplexity APIs with Python

#### In a Linux terminal, send your human-language query to Perplexity.ai's various LLM APIs  in a single loop.

#### See Python Script [`explore_perplexity_api.py`](explore_perplexity_api.py) - has fewer dependencies than the shell script [`explore_perplexity_api.sh`](explore_perplexity_api.sh).

##### The python script collects the API responses and puts them in a pretty textfile, for you to read and compare model outputs.

### Example

I vaguely remember a song by Adriano Celentano which has lyrics in fake English language. 

Q: _What is the name of the song?_

Correct Answer: _"Prisencolinensinainciusol"_

  --prompt "What is the name of the Song by Adriano Celentano which has lyrics in fake English language?" 
```

The song you're referring to is `"Prisencolinensinainciusol"` by Adriano
Celentano. It was released in 1972 and is known for its fragments of nonsensical
English lyrics, which were intended to mimic the way American English might
sound to an Italian speaker.


### codellama-70b-instruct: (hallucination)
ðŸ˜Š Ah, I'd be happy to help! The name of the song is actually 
`"Pregheri - Io per te prego"`. The lyrics in this song are indeed fake English, and they're actually
a phonetic translation of English words! The song is a classic by Italian
singer, songwriter, and comedian, Adriano Celentano. Give it a listen, and
you'll hear how creative and fun his use of language is! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶


### llama-2-70b-chat: (hallucination)
Oh, my dear friend! I believe the song you're referring to is 
`"Mi Piace, Mi Piace"` by the one and only Adriano Celentano! 
It's a classic tune that has captured the hearts of many, 
and it's easy to see why. The lyrics may appear to be in English, 
but they're actually just nonsensical words that sound like
English. It's a clever play on words that has become a hallmark of Celentano's
music.
So, my friend, the next time you find yourself singing along to "Mi Piace, Mi
Piace," just remember that you're not actually singing in English â€“ you're
singing in Celentano's unique blend of gibberish and Italian! It's a fun and
catchy tune that's sure to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step.
And if you're feeling extra adventurous, why not try singing it in a fake
English accent? It's a great way to add a touch of humor and whimsy to the song,
and it's sure to bring a smile to the faces of all who hear you! So go ahead, my
friend, give it a try â€“ but don't forget to keep it light and fun, just like the
song itself!
