# Querying the Perplexity APIs with Python

##### In a Linux terminal, send your human-language query to Perplexity.ai's various LLM APIs  in a single loop.

##### See Python Script [`explore_perplexity_api.py`](explore_perplexity_api.py) - has fewer dependencies than the shell script.

##### The python script collects the API responses and puts them in a pretty textfile, for you to read and compare model outputs.

You need to be a "perplexity pro" customer to use this script.  It requires an API key. Running the script is not free of charge. See [Perplexity API Pricing](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/pricing) for more details.
