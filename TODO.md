### The "find-assistant" script

##### (Under construction)

The `find-assistant` script is a simple script that will propose different custom instructions to pass to the AI system's "assistant" role.

Usage:

```bash
find-assistant Aristotle <enter>
```

Response:

The shell will turn into this:

![terminal window screenshot](resources/find-assistant-screenshot-terminalwindow-ann.png)

This will not be passed to the AI systems yet. It is just a potential future improvement to the script, to help you find  more focused results.
